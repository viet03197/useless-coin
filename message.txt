Node communicates with node:
    - When new node node2 connects to existing node node1
        + Current condition: node1 listening at port 8000
        + node1 accepts a connection from node2
        + node1 generates a (children) port for node2. Example 8001-8003 for 8000
            *This is sent together with the connection info, so that they can send wallet
        + Broadcast the info of the newly connected node to all my others
            *At this time the new node doesn't have wallet, ignore  our wallet
Wallet w1 wants to make a transaction w2:
    - w1 makes a connect to its node, and sends the information
    -
